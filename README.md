# üõ†Ô∏è systems-workshop

This repo gathers smaller-scale tools and demos related to systems programming and infrastructure. Topics include low-level I/O, process and signal management, access control, backup automation, and environment tooling.

All included projects are tracked as Git submodules and live inside the `projects/` directory. This allows each tool to remain independently versioned while making them easy to explore as a group. See below for cloning instructions if you're unfamiliar with Git submodules.

## üì¶ Included Projects

| Submodule         | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| [`assembly-io`](https://github.com/duanegoodner/assembly-io) | MASM-based 32-bit Windows program for low-level integer I/O and mean calculation. Demonstrates the verbosity and intricacy of even basic tasks in Assembly. |
| [`smallsh`](https://github.com/duanegoodner/smallsh) | A lightweight Linux shell written in C. Supports job control, I/O redirection, and foreground/background process management. |
| [`pygetfacl`](https://github.com/duanegoodner/pygetfacl) | Python wrapper for the Linux `getfacl` command. Converts ACL information into structured Python objects for programmatic access. |
| [`btrfs-restic`](https://github.com/duanegoodner/btrfs-restic) | Backup tool that snapshots BTRFS subvolumes and sends them to a remote Restic repository. Emphasizes snapshot-based consistency and simple, secure remote storage. |
| [`convertpytoml`](https://github.com/duanegoodner/convertpytoml) | Command-line utility to convert pyproject.toml files between pip-style and Poetry-style formats. Helps smooth workflow transitions between packaging tools. |
